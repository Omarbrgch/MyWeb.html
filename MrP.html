    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 25px;">Mr. P is a Mythic Brawler who has moderate health and damage. He attacks with suitcases that bounce and deal additional damage. His Super deploys a home base that periodically spawns a robo-porter that follows and attacks enemies. His first Gadget, Service Bell, significantly increases the damage and health of the current porter. His second Gadget, Porter Reinforcements, spawns a weaker porter at the end of Mr. P's next attackâ€™s range. Mr. P's first Star Power, Handle With Care, periodically makes his suitcase deal more damage after bouncing. His second Star Power, Revolving Door, increases the damage and health of the porters spawned by Mr. P's Super.</p>
