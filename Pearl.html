    <h1>Pearl</h1>
    <p>Pearl is an Epic Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 in Season 20: Back to Ranger Ranch, or can be obtained from the Starr Road. She has moderately high health and variable damage output. Pearl's Heat bar charges over time, and allows her to deal more damage the more it is charged. She attacks by shooting a spread-out burst of cookies in a sweeping pattern that gradually depletes her Heat. Her Super is a shockwave that deals very high damage and knocks surviving enemies back in a large radius while also destroying obstacles. Her first Gadget, Overcooked, allows her next attack to fire burning cookies at an enemy. If one of the cookies hit, it damages them over time. Her second Gadget, Made With Love, allows her next attack to heal allies over time. Her first Star Power, Heat Retention, decreases the Heat bar's reduction when using her Super. Her second Star Power, Heat Shield, reduces incoming damage while charging her Heat. Her Hypercharge, Pyrolitic, allows her Super to leave a burning area on the ground, burning enemies if they touch it.</p>
