    <p sty>Dynamike is a Super Rare Brawler who has low health but a high damage output. He attacks by lobbing sticks of dynamite over obstacles that blow up and deal high damage in a medium radius. For his Super, he lobs a large barrel of dynamite that deals very high damage and knocks surviving enemies back in a large radius while also destroying obstacles. His first Gadget, Fidget Spinner, allows him to spin with a speed boost and rapidly fire sticks of dynamite in a large radius around himself. His second Gadget, Satchel Charge, makes Dynamike's next main attack stun enemies briefly. His first Star Power, Dyna-Jump, allows his attack, Super and Hypercharge to propel him over obstacles and Brawlers. His second Star Power, Demolition, allows his Super to deal more damage. His Hypercharge, Boomer, allows his Super to spawn multiple sticks of dynamite upon detonation in every direction that blow up and deal high damage in a small radius.</p>
